# Principles for Better Design

*Lecture given from course professor*

### Simplicity - Keep it simple stupid
Ask : Is it the simplest possible design I can think of?

### Incremental Improvement
Ask : Do I need all these components right now?  
Good design = 'discover your design'

### No Premature Optimization
Ask : If I don't optimize, does the project fail?
Don't fall into the temptation of optimization

### Always consider the fundamental idea of Computational Thinking (very important)
- divide and conuquer
- inductive definition
- seperation of concern
- composibility
- abstraction
- data representation
