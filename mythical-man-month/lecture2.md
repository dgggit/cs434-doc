# Mythical Man Month - 2

### Chapter : The surgical team

### Productivity Variations
- Emperical measure of experienced programmers' performance. :
  - productivity ratio : 10:1
  - program speed/space measurements : 5:1
  
### A few minds as possible
- *(if 200-man project has 25 managers, then fire 175 troops and put managers back to programming!)*
- Small, Sharp team, up to 10 people by common concensus
- What if we want to build mega-scale programs?
- Goal : Keep few minds in for design

### Mill's Proposal
- Partition each segment of a large project into teams, but each team should have surgical teams.
- Overally, the sergical teams make up project.

### Composing Surgical Team
| Position | Summary | Details|
|---|---|---|
| Surgeon | chief programmer | 10 yrs of experience, settles all differences of judgements |
| Copilot | alter ego of surgeon | still know all the codes, researcher, insurance against disaster|
| Toolsmith | set up all the tools | support surgeon on tools
| Tester | | devices test cases and data |

etc: Admin, Editor, ..
** What do I want to be? **

Draw a radically **simply communcational flow** -> Key point!

### Surgical Team is a Culture
- All members **MUST** follow the rules.
- No democracy is allowed in software development, it's an aristocracy with no apology need
- The surgeon's ability is absolutely critical.

### Amazon's model
- Minimize the team (5~8 engineers)
- Every decision is made in the team
- Design / Build / Test / Deploy
- Minimize coordination problem

> Consider 5 roles and 100 members.  
> Case 1 : 5 team of 20 members.  
> Case 2 : 20 teams with 5 members, each with specialized roles.  
> The second case is much better!

### Q. How to prevent your project from falling because of its own overhead?

#### 1 & 2 & 3. Documentation
Formalize communication in documents.
- text documents
- graphics
- paper (paragraphs)
- electronic form

#### 4. Write with UML (Unified Modeling Language)
- A standard way to visualize design of a system.
- In real, many corps do not use : Too complex
- Informal notation upon agreement is enough

### Essential vs Accidential Difficulties
- Essential : hard part of software design
  - specification, design, testing of this conceptual construct
- Accidental : not the hard part
  - representing the construct
  - testing fidelity of the representation

### Difficulties In Software Technology
- Essence : can never be eliminated
  - it's the nature of software
    - comlexity
    - conformity ; different interfaces by different people
    - changeability ; changes in environment force changes on software product
    - invisibility ; software is invisible
- Accidents
  - can be eliminated with effort
