# Mythical Man Month - 1

### Brief introduction on the book
- Bible of software engineering and project management
- human elements of of software engineering

### Tar Pit
- Programming is fun!
- But is hard at the same time

### Mythical Man-Month
> Q : Software projects lack of calendar time in most cases. Why?

It takes so much effort to be a **ten times programmer**.  
In worst cases, one's productivity can be **0** or even become **negative** : Bugs or too complex codes.
Programming also concerns human element.


### Optimism : All programmers are optimists
"This time it will surely run" or, "Finally! found the last bug!" => Why this is frequent?
- Characteristics of Computer programming
  - Medium is tractable : writing codes has no or little cost.
  - People are still fun though they lack in programming skills.
  - They have less evidence of their optimism. => Less design time.
- Abandoning optimism
  - would let us find design errors
  - results in saving time

### Naive Man-Month ?
Only works when there are *no communication among workers*.
Conclusion : Primary goal is to reduce communication overhead.
  
### Performance
As number of people grows, communication cost quadraples : `O(n^2)`.
Thus, too many people would conversely lead to overall performance degradation. 

### Systems Test
- Rule of thumb : 
  - 1/3 planning
  - 1/6 coding
  - 1/4 component test and early system test
  - 1/4 system test & all components in hand
  
 ### Brooks's Law
 > Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
 We can derive schedules using fewer man and more months.
 
 ### Time
 > The most crucial resource in software project is TIME.
 Take priority!
 
 ### Reducing communication with myself/ourselves
 1. DOCUMENTIZE everything!
 - Result : reduces time in naive, simple job.
 2. Automate testing time and working time. (노가다 X)
 - Use varieties of great tools
